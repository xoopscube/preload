# preload
xcl preload

The delegate and preload mechanisms of XOOPSCube.

**Delegate** is a mechanism in XCL that safely encapsulates a method, similar to a function pointer in C and C++. Unlike C function pointers, delegates are object-oriented, type safe, and secure.
**Preload** is a mechanism to enable preprocessing before the module execution.

**Delegate** and **Preload** are inherently different mechanisms and can be used independently.
There are many single-file hacks to change or extend a module processing and behavior using **Delegate** within **Preload** mechanism.

Learn more about **Preload** and how to implement delegates from the Wiki documentation examples.
